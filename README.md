R Markdown scripts demonstrating data extraction, data processing, bootstrapping and GAMMs
This repository stores R Markdown scripts and enough data to demonstrate basic spatial data extraction, data processing, data exploration, and modelling of data. Models include ordinary least-squares regression, generalized linear models, and generalized additive mixed models. The scripts culminate in analyses of effects of time of day/night and time of year on song activity in three songbird species (Swainson's Thrush, Tennessee Warbler, White-throated Sparrow), and how those effects vary for northern Alberta and southern Alberta.
